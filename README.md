API for User Authentication and Authorization with FASTAPI

FastAPI is one of fastest Python framework for API development. It is not only fast in terms of performance but it is sure and have easy to learn . Now days with the evolution of AI and ML this is the most favourable framework for API development. So I am making an API layer for User Authentication and Authorization with FastAPI which I can integrate with any project wherever I will need of Authentication. We will create User Registration along with User Login for JWT token.
